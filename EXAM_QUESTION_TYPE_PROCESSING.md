# Exam Question Type Processing with AI

## Overview
This document describes how the exam system processes uploaded documents to automatically detect and categorize different question types using AI (Groq).

## Supported Question Types

1. **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)** - Traditional questions with 4 options
2. **True/False Questions** - Questions with True/False options
3. **Fill-in-the-blank Questions** - Questions requiring text input to fill blanks
4. **Open/Short Answer Questions** - Essay-type questions requiring detailed text responses

## Current Issues

### Problem Identified
The current implementation has several issues with question type processing:

1. **Missing Question Type Field**: The upload controller doesn't pass the `type` field from AI processing to the Question model
2. **Incorrect Answer Handling**: All questions are treated as MCQ, converting correct answers to indices
3. **Null Type Defaulting**: Questions with null type default to 'mcq' instead of proper type detection
4. **No AI-based Type Detection**: The AI prompt doesn't emphasize question type classification

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompt for Question Type Detection

Update the Groq service prompt to better emphasize question type classification:

```javascript
const prompt = `Extract exam questions from this text section for a ${examType.toUpperCase()} test. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Analyze each question to determine the most appropriate question type based on the question format and content.

Return 5-8 high-quality questions in JSON format only. Support these question types:

1. "mcq" - Multiple choice with 4 options (use when question asks for selection from given choices)
2. "true_false" - True/False questions (use for yes/no or true/false statements)
3. "fill_blank" - Fill-in-the-blank questions (use when question contains blanks to be filled)
4. "open" - Open-ended/essay questions (use for questions requiring detailed written responses)

ANALYSIS CRITERIA FOR QUESTION TYPE DETECTION:
- MCQ: Question contains "which of the following", "select the best", "choose", or provides multiple options
- TRUE_FALSE: Question is a statement that can be judged as true or false
- FILL_BLANK: Question contains blank spaces (____) or asks "fill in the blank"
- OPEN: Question asks for explanation, description, reasons, or detailed analysis

JSON FORMAT:
[
  {
    "question": "The question text",
    "type": "mcq", // CRITICAL: Must specify correct type
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"], // Required for MCQ/True_False
    "correctAnswer": "Option A", // For MCQ/True_False: correct option text, for open: sample answer, for fill_blank: exact answer
    "points": 1,
    "section": "Section A" // Include if applicable
  }
]

Text content from section ${chunkNumber} of ${fileName}:
${chunk}

REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract relevant questions from this section only
- Create appropriate ${examType.toUpperCase()} exam questions
- CRITICALLY: Analyze each question to determine the CORRECT question type
- For MCQ: Provide 4 options and specify the correct answer text
- For TRUE_FALSE: Provide options ["True", "False"] and correct answer
- For FILL_BLANK: Provide question with blanks and exact correct answer text
- For OPEN: Omit options field and provide sample answer in correctAnswer
- Clear, unambiguous questions
- JSON format only, no extra text
- Generate 5-8 comprehensive questions per section`;
```

### 2. Fix Question Creation Logic

Update the upload controller to properly handle different question types:

```javascript
// Create questions from AI-processed content
if (processedQuestions && processedQuestions.length > 0) {
  const questionsWithExamId = processedQuestions.map(q => {
    // Handle different question types properly
    let correctAnswer = q.correctAnswer;
    let options = q.options || [];
    
    // For MCQ and True/False, convert correct answer to index
    if ((q.type === 'mcq' || q.type === 'true_false') && options.length > 0) {
      const correctAnswerIndex = options.indexOf(q.correctAnswer);
      correctAnswer = correctAnswerIndex !== -1 ? correctAnswerIndex : 0;
    }
    
    return {
      question: q.question,
      type: q.type || 'mcq', // Ensure type is always set
      options: options,
      correctAnswer: correctAnswer,
      points: q.points || 1,
      examId: exam._id
    };
  });
  await Question.insertMany(questionsWithExamId);
}
```

### 3. Update Question Model Validation

Ensure the Question model properly validates question types:

```javascript
// In Question.js model
type: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['mcq', 'open', 'fill_blank', 'true_false'],
  default: 'mcq',
  required: true
},

// Add validation to ensure proper field combinations
validate: [
  {
    validator: function() {
      // MCQ and True/False must have options
      if ((this.type === 'mcq' || this.type === 'true_false') && (!this.options || this.options.length === 0)) {
        return false;
      }
      // Open and Fill-blank should not have options
      if ((this.type === 'open' || this.type === 'fill_blank') && this.options && this.options.length > 0) {
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    },
    message: 'Question type and options combination is invalid'
  }
]
```

### 4. Improve Frontend Question Loading

Update the frontend to handle null types properly:

```dart
factory Question.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
  // Handle null type explicitly and validate
  String questionType = json['type'] != null ? json['type'] : 'mcq';
  
  // Validate question type
  const validTypes = ['mcq', 'open', 'fill_blank', 'true_false'];
  if (!validTypes.contains(questionType)) {
    questionType = 'mcq'; // Default to mcq for invalid types
  }
  
  return Question(
    id: json['_id'] ?? json['id'] ?? '',
    question: json['question'] ?? '',
    type: questionType,
    options: List<String>.from(json['options'] ?? []),
    points: json['points'] ?? 1,
    section: json['section'],
  );
}
```

## Testing Process

### 1. Test Document with Mixed Question Types
Create a test document containing:
- Multiple choice questions
- True/false statements
- Fill-in-the-blank questions
- Open-ended questions

### 2. Verification Steps
1. Upload document through the exam creation interface
2. Check that AI correctly identifies question types
3. Verify questions are stored with correct types in database
4. Test that frontend displays appropriate input fields for each type
5. Validate that grading works correctly for each question type

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **AI Returns Wrong Question Type**
   - Solution: Improve the AI prompt with more specific examples
   - Add validation in the backend to correct obvious misclassifications

2. **Null or Missing Type Field**
   - Solution: Always default to 'mcq' with proper validation
   - Add logging to identify when type detection fails

3. **Incorrect Answer Format**
   - Solution: Add validation for correctAnswer field based on question type
   - Ensure proper conversion between text answers and indices

## Future Improvements
