///
/// "Offline" here means *the backend cannot be reached*, not merely that the
/// radio is off. Those are different things and the distinction matters: a
/// phone on a captive-portal WiFi, or one whose DNS is failing, reports a
/// perfectly healthy transport to connectivity_plus while every API call dies.
/// The screen the user actually sees in that case is "Failed to load courses",
/// so transport alone is the wrong signal to drive the offline guard.
///
/// Two independent inputs are combined:
///  * [_transportDown] — connectivity_plus. Fast, but only knows about
///    interfaces. Authoritative when it says *down*, unreliable when it says up.
///  * [_serverUnreachable] — real connection failures reported by the API
///    client, plus a probe against the backend health endpoint used to recover.
///
/// Exposed as a [ChangeNotifier] so it can be handed to GoRouter's
/// `refreshListenable`; every state flip re-runs the router redirect, which is
