/**
 * Resolves who the caller is inside a course community and attaches the
 * result to `req.community`.
 *
 * Membership rules (deliberately mirroring the rest of the platform so the
 * community never becomes a separate permission system):
 *  - admins are members of every course community with teacher powers
 *  - a teacher with an active TeacherAssignment for the course gets teacher powers
 *  - a student with an Enrollment for the course is a member
 *  - everyone else gets 403
 *
 * An expired enrollment keeps read/write access to the community: the peer
 * work a student did there (their groups, discussions, submissions) should not
 * vanish the moment their course access window lapses. `hasExpiredAccess` is
 * exposed so callers can surface it if they need to.
